# Simple SFML Engine (SSE)
I'm learning SFML, and to help me with that, I'm building an SFML engine.

This is the absolute barebones for a game, and don't expect for me to have included everything needed in a game engine.

## Limitations
Because I am new to SFML there are some things that need fixing and optimization.
I'm also not the best C++ programmer, so there are plenty of areas with ugly code, feel free to fix it and contribute.
I would be very happy if people would post their contributions with an explantation in the changelog.txt

## License
Right now I still deciding on a License, I am leaning towards a GPL 3.1+ License, so you might as well treat it as such.
